## What is Alphonics?

> Alphonics is an application based on big business like Spotify, Deezer or Apple Music, focused on leisure, diversity and the freedom to express, listen or enjoy your music without difficulties.

With our application we aim to change the way users experience music, to make it something closer to them, with a different format to the one they are used to from our competitors.

We also aim to ensure that there is no limit when it comes to discovering emerging artists or new genres, and with our system we will further help new artists to open up on our platform.

### Our objectives

> Our goal is to compete with the highest bidders, making a difference and creating a stable business for emerging and new artists.

Something we want to highlight on the platform is the support for local artists, that they are given more to shine and that users can discover them so that they have a chance and their merit is recognised.

With our tools anyone can upload their creations or produce them and be an artist, we want to make it possible for any user to enjoy both creating and discovering music.

#### Why Alphonics?

> We need to make it possible for artists to create their music, and for users to discover the artists and their music.

If you are looking for a place to discover new music, and to support local artists, Alphonics is the place for you. Better than Spotify, Deezer or Apple Music.

That is because we want to give a different experience to users, to make it possible for them to discover new artists and to support them.
